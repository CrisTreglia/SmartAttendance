# Face Recognition with API Integration (C# & Python) - UNDER DEVELOPMENT

This project combines a C# API for student photo management with a Python-based real-time facial recognition system. The Python script fetches student photos from the C# API, which sources its data from a database, to enhance the recognition model dynamically.

## Key Features

* **C# API with Database Integration:** Manages and serves student photos from a database in SQL Server.
* **Real-time Face Detection:**  Identifies faces from a webcam feed using OpenCV.
* **API-Driven Model Updates:** Fetches student photos from the C# API and dynamically incorporates them into the recognition model.
* **Error Handling:** Includes robust error handling for API requests, database interactions, and file operations.

## Requirements

* **C# Side:**
    * .NET SDK 
    * [ASP.NET Core] 
    * [SQL Server] 
* **Python Side:**
    * Python (3.x recommended)
    * OpenCV (`opencv-contrib-python`)
    * `requests` library
